This dataset is from a Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/seoul-bike-trip-duration-prediction

<b>Problem Statement: </b>The duration of a trip is the most crucial measure in all modes of transportation. Hence, it is crucial to predict the trip time precisely for the advancement of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and traveler information systems. The prediction can be done using the Seoul Bike data and weather data. We need to use this combination of Seoul Bike data and weather data to do the trip duration prediction.â€‹

In this project I have done an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis, visualized the data with amazing plots, build different models, visualized feature importance, did hyper parameter tunning of each model. Finally I found out that, from all the columns in the data Distance is the most important feature of them all and after Hyperparameter Tuning XGB Regressor performed much better when compared to remaining models.
